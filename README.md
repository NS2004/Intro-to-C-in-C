# Intro-to-C-in-C
C++ program 
For one of my high school freshman computer science classes, out quarterly project was to write a Word/text document describing the basics of a languages syntax 
- other than JavaScript as that was the language the course was taught in. Instead of just writing down how to make a for loop or declare a variable, I decided to 
take the project one step further. I learned the essentials of C++ and made a program in that language which a user can interact with to learn the basics of C++. 
This way, instead of reading a Word document on C++, they can see the program written in the language. Although the project is minor in scope, it was an effort to go 
the extra mile when I was not expected to and helped increase my knowledge at a young age.
